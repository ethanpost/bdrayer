## Linux Command Line Basics

### File System Navigation and Management
- ls - Lists directory contents
  - ls -l shows detailed information including permissions and size
- cd - Changes current working directory
  - Used to navigate between directories
- pwd - Prints current working directory path
  - Confirms your location in the file system
- mkdir - Creates new directories
  - Helps organize files
- rmdir - Removes empty directories
- cp - Copies files or directories
- mv - Moves or renames files or directories
- rm - Removes files or directories permanently
- touch - Creates empty files or updates timestamps

### File Content Operations

- echo - Prints text to standard output
- grep - Searches for patterns in files
  - Example: grep "search_term" file.txt
- sed - Stream editor for text transformation
  - Example: sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt

  - Manipulates and formats text data
- sort - Sorts lines of text files
- uniq - Reports or omits repeated lines
  - Requires sorted input
- wc - Counts words, lines, characters in files
  - wc -l counts lines

### System Information
- uname - Prints system information
  - uname -a shows all system details
